 Recycled Materials (in this context)  are materials that are commonly used in computer parts that have been used before. Using recycled materials helps preserve the environment more effectively due to the fact that it will lessen the amount of valuables needed.
<h4> Longetivity of Device </h4>  The longevity of a device can be a great way to help nullify the environmental impact computer production has on the environment because the longer your device can keep it's purpose and efficiency the less demand for new devices which require more extraction, mining and packaging </p>  </li> </ul> </td>

  Recycling can be a very effective and excellent option when disposing of your device because it allows your devices valuable materials to be used multiple times. Joining a E-Waste Prevention Program may help
 <h4> <b>Maintain/Upgrade </b></h4>
 Repairing your device is one of the best things you can do to minimize the effect that E-Waste has on the environment. This allows your device to gain more longevity and remain it's functionality.
 <h4> <b> Donate </b></h4>
Donating and selling are also great options because they not only help others but at the same time increase the length of usage for that device.

Contamination (in the context of E-Waste) is when harmful and toxic materials seep or leech into water and soil.
<h4><b>Why is Contamination bad?</b></h4> Contamination is bad because it can not only harm the a-biotic part of an environment but also the biotic part through water drinking, plants being grown in soil that could have been contaminated and more.

    <li> E-Waste Prevention Programs are programs that are made to help stop the impact that computer device disposal has on the environment through recycling.
