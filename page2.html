Moreover, it's not just the pure amount of recourses needed that is the problem, but also the consequences of obtaining these materials. Some consequences of extracting these materials include habitat destruction, soil erosion and water pollution

Computer Use contributes to a major amount of energy usage in our society, which contributes to the releasing of greenhouse gases. <b>Video Streaming</b>
  Over 300 million tons of carbon dioxide are emitted into the atmosphere annually due to the streaming of online videos alone.
<b>IT Infrastructure</b>
IT infrastructure accounts for over 7% of all carbon emissions released and will increase over time.
<b>Amount of energy created from fossil fuels</b>
Over 65% of energy is created through fossil fuels according to <a href= "http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-sources/electricity/"> Nas.Edu </a> and the consequence of burning and extracting fossil fuels include carbon emissions. </p>  </li> </ul> </td>
<td  style = "background-color: grey;"> <ul> <li> <h4> So we know computer use emits Carbon Emissions, however, why are Carbon Emissions bad?</h4> </li> <li><p>
There are the main cause of global warming as they are the most common greenhouse gas A greenhouse gas traps heat into the atmosphere and slowly affects the Ozone layer negatively The heating on the lower atmosphere can lead to flooding, habitual loss and more.

<td  style = "background-color: grey;" > <ul> <li> <h4> How does computer disposal affect the environement </h4> </li> <li> <p> <h4> <b> Toxic Chemical Release </b> </h4>
  The presence of computers and related devices in garbage fills can release toxic metals and chemicals into the natural environment that affect the plants and animals negatively 
 <h4> <b>Soil and Water Contamination </b></h4>
  E-Waste (when not properly disposed) can have multiple consequences as well. Firstly, the substances used in computers like cadmium can leech into the soil and water, which will contaminate water and land recourses, and will affect plants and animals negatively.
 <h4> <b> E-Waste </b></h4>
  Computers are made of a large amount of valuable and rare materials, like gold. The waste of these precious materials isn't exactly the problem thought, because if there is less recycling of these valuable materials then there must be a need for more mining extracting and packaging which as we know harms the environment in multiple ways.

 </p>  </li> </ul> </td>
<td  style = "background-color: grey;"> <ul> <li> <h4> Contamination</h4> </li> <li><p>
Contamination (in the context of E-Waste) is when harmful and toxic materials seep or leech into water and soil.
<h4><b>Why is Contamination bad?</b></h4> Contamination is bad because it can not only harm the a-biotic part of an environment but also the biotic part through water drinking, plants being grown in soil that could have been contaminated and more.
</p> </li> </ul>

</td>
  <td  style = "background-color: grey;" > <ul> <li> <h4> What is E-Waste? </h4> </li> <li> <p> E-Waste is the disposal of any electronic device without the intention of re-use or recycling.
<li><h4> Why is E-Waste Bad for the Environment?</h4></li>
    <li> E-Waste is not ideal in an Environmental perspective because it is not biodegradable or in other words it does not decompose in any sort and accumulates among the soil, water and atmosphere. This can cause multiple consequences, including hazardous materials entering the atmosphere and water, potentially posing a threat to local life.</li>
